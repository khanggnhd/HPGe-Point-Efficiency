FEPE of the detector depends on many factors, among which two factors are often investigated of being energy and distance. The change in FEPE value according to energy is quite complex especially when calculating the FEPE in a wide energy range (from a few keV to approximately 2.5 MeV). To solve this problem, the normal approach uses the CF method or the VPD method in which many different mathematical functions corresponding to different energy ranges are used to achieve higher accuracy. In general, this approach has been shown to be effective but still reveals the limitation in calculating the FEPE in the low energy range. Furthermore, finding a function that depicts the change of FEPE according to several variables (energy, distance, etc.) based on the above approaches is complex. Obviously, proposing a model capable of calculating FEPE according to the whole energy range and the different distances with higher accuracy will enhance the working performance of a detector in practical application. This is also the great advantage of the ML model when it can handle complex datasets, datasets dependent on multiple variables, and datasets with complex transformations.
